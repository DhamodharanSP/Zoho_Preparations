**Time:** 35 Minutes | **Questions:** 10

### 1. Profit and Loss
**Question:**
A shopkeeper sold an item (A) at a 20% loss, which originally cost ₹4500. [cite_start]He then used the money from this sale to buy another item (B), which he sold for a 30% profit. [cite: 4, 5] What is the total profit or loss from both these transactions?

**Solution:**
1.  **Item A (Loss):**
    * Cost Price (CP) = ₹4500
    * Selling Price (SP) = $4500 \times (1 - 0.20) = 4500 \times 0.8 = ₹3600$.
2.  **Item B (Profit):**
    * He uses the ₹3600 to buy Item B. So, CP of B = ₹3600.
    * SP of B = $3600 \times (1 + 0.30) = 3600 \times 1.3 = ₹4680$.
3.  **Total Result:**
    * Initial Investment: ₹4500
    * Final Return: ₹4680
    * Profit = $4680 - 4500 = 180$.

**Answer:** **Profit of ₹180**

### 2. Ratios
**Question:**
[cite_start]In a school, the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls is 5:3. [cite: 6] [cite_start]If there are 40 more boys than girls, how many students are there in the school? [cite: 7]

**Solution:**
1.  Ratio $B:G = 5:3$. Let Boys = $5x$ and Girls = $3x$.
2.  Difference: $5x - 3x = 40 \Rightarrow 2x = 40 \Rightarrow x = 20$.
3.  Total Students = $5x + 3x = 8x$.
4.  Total = $8 \times 20 = 160$.

**Answer:** **160 Students**

### 3. Problems on Ages
**Question:**
[cite_start]How many years younger is C compared to A, given that the combined age of A and B is 12 years more than the combined age of B and C? [cite: 8]

**Solution:**
1.  Equation: $(A + B) = (B + C) + 12$.
2.  Subtract B from both sides: $A = C + 12$.
3.  Rearrange: $A - C = 12$.

**Answer:** **12 years**

### 4. Pipes and Cisterns
**Question:**
Three pipes (A, B, C) can fill a tank in 6 hours. They start together, but after 2 hours, C is turned off. [cite_start]A and B take 7 more hours to fill the tank. [cite: 9, 10, 11] [cite_start]How long would it take for pipe C to fill the tank by itself? [cite: 12]

**Solution:**
1.  $(A+B+C)$ fill $\frac{1}{6}$ of the tank per hour.
2.  In 2 hours, they fill $2 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. Remaining: $\frac{2}{3}$.
3.  $(A+B)$ fill this $\frac{2}{3}$ in 7 hours.
    * Rate of $(A+B) = \frac{2/3}{7} = \frac{2}{21}$.
4.  Rate of C = Rate(Combined) - Rate(A+B)
    * $C = \frac{1}{6} - \frac{2}{21} = \frac{7 - 4}{42} = \frac{3}{42} = \frac{1}{14}$.
5.  Time for C = 14 hours.

**Answer:** **14 Hours**

### 5. Tournament Math
**Question:**
[cite_start]In a chess tournament, there are 6 rounds, and each player plays exactly once against every other player. [cite: 13] [cite_start]How many players are there in the tournament? [cite: 14]

**Solution:**
1.  In a "Round Robin" tournament where everyone plays everyone once:
    * Number of games per player = $N - 1$.
2.  If the rounds equal the number of games per player (which is standard for chess tournaments where everyone plays 1 game per round), then $N - 1 = 6$.
3.  $N = 7$.

**Answer:** **7 Players**

### 6. Mensuration
**Question:**
[cite_start]A rectangular garden has a length that is 4 meters more than its width. [cite: 15] [cite_start]If the area of the garden is 140 square meters, what are the dimensions of the garden? [cite: 16]

**Solution:**
1.  $L = W + 4$.
2.  $Area = L \times W = (W+4)W = 140$.
3.  $W^2 + 4W - 140 = 0$.
4.  $(W+14)(W-10) = 0$. W must be positive, so $W=10$.
5.  $L = 10 + 4 = 14$.

**Answer:** **Length: 14m, Width: 10m**

### 7. Calendars
**Question:**
[cite_start]What day of the week will it be 132 days from today, if today is Thursday? [cite: 17]

**Solution:**
1.  $132 \mod 7 = 6$ (Since $126$ is a multiple of 7, remainder is 6).
2.  Thursday + 6 days = Wednesday.

**Answer:** **Wednesday**

### 8. Percentages
**Question:**
[cite_start]The price of a shirt is reduced by 20% during a sale. [cite: 18] [cite_start]If the original price was ₹500, what is the sale price of the shirt? [cite: 19]

**Solution:**
1.  Discount = $20\%$ of $500 = 100$.
2.  Price = $500 - 100 = 400$.

**Answer:** **₹400**

### 9. Number Series
**Question:**
[cite_start]Sequence: 14, 28, 20, 40, 32, 64... What number should come next? [cite: 20]

**Solution:**
1.  Pattern: $\times 2, -8, \times 2, -8 \dots$
2.  $14 \times 2 = 28$
3.  $28 - 8 = 20$
4.  $20 \times 2 = 40$
5.  $40 - 8 = 32$
6.  $32 \times 2 = 64$
7.  Next: $64 - 8 = 56$.

**Answer:** **56**

### 10. Time, Speed, Distance
**Question:**
[cite_start]A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns at a speed of 75 km/h. [cite: 23] [cite_start]If the total travel time is 9 hours, what is the one-way distance between the two cities? [cite: 24]

**Solution:**
1.  Let distance be $D$.
2.  $\frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{75} = 9$.
3.  LCM of 60 and 75 is 300.
4.  $\frac{5D + 4D}{300} = 9 \Rightarrow \frac{9D}{300} = 9$.
5.  $D = 300$.

**Answer:** **300 km**
